## Get it now

Run ✅ `pip3 install newspaper3k` ✅

NOT ⛔ `pip3 install newspaper` ⛔

On python3 you must install `newspaper3k`, **not** `newspaper`. `newspaper` is our python2 library.
Although installing newspaper is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`\_, you will
run into fixable issues if you are trying to install on ubuntu.

**If you are on Debian / Ubuntu**, install using the following:

- Install `pip3` command needed to install `newspaper3k` package::

  \$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip

- Python development version, needed for Python.h::

  \$ sudo apt-get install python-dev

- lxml requirements::

  \$ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev

- For PIL to recognize .jpg images::

  \$ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev

NOTE: If you find problem installing `libpng12-dev`, try installing `libpng-dev`.

- Download NLP related corpora::

  \$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codelucas/newspaper/master/download_corpora.py | python3

- Install the distribution via pip::

  \$ pip3 install newspaper3k

**If you are on OSX**, install using the following, you may use both homebrew or macports:

::

    $ brew install libxml2 libxslt

    $ brew install libtiff libjpeg webp little-cms2

    $ pip3 install newspaper3k

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codelucas/newspaper/master/download_corpora.py | python3

**Otherwise**, install with the following:

NOTE: You will still most likely need to install the following libraries via your package manager

- PIL: `libjpeg-dev` `zlib1g-dev` `libpng12-dev`
- lxml: `libxml2-dev` `libxslt-dev`
- Python Development version: `python-dev`

::

    $ pip3 install newspaper3k

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codelucas/newspaper/master/download_corpora.py | python3

## Installation

```
composer require 2dareis2do/newspaper3k-php-wrapper

After installing the NLTK package, please do install the necessary 
datasets/models for specific functions to work.
